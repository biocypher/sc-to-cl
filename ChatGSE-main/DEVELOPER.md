# ðŸ”¬ Developer Guide
Thank you for considering to contribute to the project! This guide will help you
to get started with the development of the project. If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask them in the issue tracker or in our [Chat 
Room](https://biocypher.zulipchat.com).

## Formal Requirements
We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. Please
make sure that you have set up the environment correctly before starting
development. If you want to fix dependency issues, please do so in the Poetry
framework. If Poetry does not work for you for some reason, please let us know.

## Small Contributions
If you want to contribute a small change (e.g. a bugfix), you can probably
immediately go ahead and create a pull request. For more substantial changes or
additions, please read on.

## Larger Contributions
If you want to contribute a larger change, please create an issue first. This
will allow us to discuss the change and make sure that it fits into the project.
It can happen that development for a feature is already in progress, so it is
important to check first to avoid duplicate work. You can also check the
[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/projects/5) for more info on
planned and ongoing work. If you have any questions, feel free to approach us in
any way you like.
